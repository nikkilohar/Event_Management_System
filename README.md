# Event_Management_System
**Welcome to my event management system project**, where you can easily organize events, manage registrations, and book tickets, all with just a few clicks. This system provides a hassle-free experience for both event organizers and attendees, making event management a breeze.

I developed this project as part of my BCA final-year submission. It was created during my certification program at **DMKVA MULTISOLUTION Event management company, Jalgaon** to demonstrate practical skills in web development.
